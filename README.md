# CSV URL Comparison Tool

A Flask web application that compares two CSV files and finds unique HTTPS URLs between them.

## Features

- Upload two CSV files
- Select columns containing HTTPS URLs
- Find unique URLs between the files
- Download results as CSV

## Local Development

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`

## Deployment to Render.com

### Option 1: Using render.yaml (Recommended)

1. Push your code to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
2. Connect your repository to Render.com
3. Render will automatically detect the `render.yaml` file and deploy your application
4. The application will be available at the provided Render URL

### Option 2: Manual Deployment

1. Create a new Web Service on Render.com
2. Connect your Git repository
3. Configure the service:
   - **Environment**: Python
   - **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start Command**: `python app.py`
   - **Health Check Path**: `/health`

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables are automatically configured:
- `SECRET_KEY`: Automatically generated by Render
- `PYTHON_VERSION`: Set to 3.12.0

```

## Health Check

The application includes a health check endpoint at `/health` that returns "OK" with a 200 status code.

## Notes

- The application uses temporary file storage in the `uploads/` directory
- Files are automatically cleaned up after processing
- The application supports CSV files with various encodings
- Only HTTPS URLs are processed and compared
